# EHRbase Admin API

EHRbase provides some specific administration functions which are not (yet) covered by the official
openEHR REST API. As the Admin API provides some capabilities which might not be desired for production systems, the API can be (de-)activated using an environment variable / system parameter.

Please see the respective resources for details on the [EHRbase Admin API](/api/hip-ehrbase/admin).
