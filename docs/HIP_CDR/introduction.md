## Purpose

Healthcare organizations face an enormous challenge: they often lack an effective digital infrastructure. The health data collected during the patient journey is often stored in proprietary systems and is usually no longer available in a structured form for further treatment paths, analyzes or research. A dependency on the manufacturers of these systems arises because the structured health data is stored in fixed, proprietary databases. The development of interfaces between the individual proprietary systems is complex, expensive and often incorrect.
 
HIP CDR solves this problem. It provides a technical component for the central storage and semantically interoperable transfer of patient-related health information, which consistently relies on open data and technology standards and thus offers maximum manufacturer independence.
 
By using a central, manufacturer-independent data storage as a “single source of truth”, a flexible, data-centric application ecosystem is created in the target image in which all applications connected to the HIP CDR selectively query data via standardized interfaces and also retrieve new data that was generated in the application context can be played back into the CDR. This avoids having to re-capture data at different points in the patient journey, which reduces staff effort and therefore costs and at the same time significantly increases data quality.

Moreover, HIP CDR provides to build natively-interoperable application systems. It is optimized for the day-to-day transactional workload and clinical workflows. 

## Disclaimer of Use

HIP CDR is not a medical product and may not be used as such. Software that is compliant with the Medical Device Regulation can still use the data from the HIP CDR for different applications (e.g. decision support systems).  

## Who is allowed to use HIP CDR?

Operation may only be carried out by trained personnel that was educated directly from the manufacturer vitagroup AG or its authorized partners.
