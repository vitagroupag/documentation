      affected-artifact-purl: "pkg:alpine/zlib@1.2.13-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.18.4&upstream=zlib"
      detailed-analysis: "The default alpine configuration doesn't expose zlib through any network services\
         \ The crafted file has to be opened or passed to zlib. The service does not accept user input of\
         \ archive type and does not pass these kind of data directly to zlib. Therefore this vulnerability\
         \ is seen as not exploitable."
